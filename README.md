# Overview of all the files
* STM32CUBEMX_CONFIG.mp4 -> This is a video that shows the STM32CUBEMX configuration of the project that is inside the STM32F446RE Nucleo board.
* RFID_c-Function-Explanation -> This pdf file, has in some extent, explained the most important functions. In this document you have also the wiring of all the used componenets and pinouts,etc, etc.
* ISO-14443-3a && ISO-14443-2 -> These files show the standards that have been used to make this possible and explainable. These are standards for the PCD(RC522 module) to communicate with the PICC(Mifare 1k card) and vice-versa.
* MF1S50YYX_V1 -> This file is the datasheet of the MIFARE cards.
* MFRC522 -> This file is the datasheet of the RC522 "module".
* rfid-solenoid-lock.mp4 -> This is a video that shows how it is working IRL.
