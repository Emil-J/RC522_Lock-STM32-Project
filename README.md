# Overview of all the files
* STM32CUBEMX_CONFIG -> this is a stm32cubemx configuration of the project that is inside the STM32F446RE Nucleo board_ STM32CUBEIDE Project folder.
* RFID_c-Function-Explanation -> has in some extent explained the most important functions. In this document you have also the wiring of all the used componenets and pinouts,etc, etc.
* ISO-14443-3a && ISO-14443-2 -> are the standards that have been used to make this possible and explainable. These are standards for the PCD(RC522 module) to communicate with the PICC(Mifare 1k card) and vice-versa.
* MF1S50YYX_V1 -> is the datasheet of the MIFARE cards.
* MFRC522 -> is the datasheet of the RC522 "module" .
